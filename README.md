# Web of Things
## Spatial Computing with Arduino and Node.Js
Imagine if there was a way to reduce the increasing number of accidents caused by driver negligence, drunk driving, speeding, weather conditions, and pedestrian negligence. What if we could utilize a device that continuously measures speed, analyzes drink and drive behavior, and provides a centralized platform to record and update data? This could potentially save lives and reduce the number of accidents worldwide. In this project, we explore the integration of spatial computing and Arduino technology to create a simple yet effective prototype for accident prevention. Join us in discovering how technology can make a significant impact on road safety.
